# The-Longest-Platformer-REDUX
Turbowarp remaster of The Longest Platformer, a game i made a while back.



## BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD ANYTHING
Some of the plugins i used in Turbowarp are unable to be used on Scratch itself.
This project **CANNOT** be uploaded to scratch. You will either have to download the:

- **.sb3 file** - The source of the project. Basically just the "See Inside" part.
- **.html file** - A compiled version of the project that can be run in-browser.

##  I FORGOT
i forgot to make this repository when working on it oops.
the builds start at v0.2.1 but whatever.

## PRETEND THERES MORE TO THIS README
I am lazy and just want to work on the game.
